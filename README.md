# Knowledge Graph Construction and Natural Language Querying for AI Research & Engineering

This project demonstrates the construction of a **heterogeneous Knowledge Graph (KG)** for the **AI Research & Engineering** domain, enabling **semantic integration** and **natural language querying**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Scope
We integrated three types of data:
- **Diagrammatic models** (ADOxx)  
- **Structured legacy datasets** (CSV â†’ RDF via OntoRefine)  
- **Semantic RDF triples** (linking experiments, models, APIs, monitoring records)  

The KG was deployed in **GraphDB** and linked to a **natural language agent ("Talk to Your Graph")**, enabling questions across research and engineering domains.

## ðŸ”Ž Features
- ResearchProcessModel: hypotheses, experiments, datasets, metrics  
- EngineeringArchitectureModel: ML models, APIs, monitoring data  
- Natural language queries for research, engineering, and cross-domain reasoning  
- ChatGPT connector for extended querying
